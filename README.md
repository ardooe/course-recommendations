[Dive into Ansible](https://www.udemy.com/course/diveintoansible/) - Udemy course for Ansible. Very clear language, instructor knows what they're doing and all the examples and course material works

## Programming languages

[Scala 3 & Functional Programming Essentials](https://rockthejvm.com/p/scala) - One of the best courses on [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) I have attended, simple explanations of the basic concepts behind this multiparadigm language
